# ðŸ“º Tech It Easy â€“ NOVI Frontend Module

This repository contains my solution for the **Tech It Easy Dashboard** exercise from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).  
The goal of this assignment is to practice working with **JavaScript array methods**, **helper functions**, and **React rendering** by building an internal financial dashboard for a TV store.

The app uses a static dataset of TV models (for now), displays sales and stock data, formats product information, and sorts/filter products based on user actions.
